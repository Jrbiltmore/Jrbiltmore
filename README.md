- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob Thomas Redmond  or @Jrbiltmore
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Assistive Intelligence, Functional Neuroanatomy, Brain Computer Interfaces and Unique Virtual Engagment Spaces
- My past is a bit complicated and trival to me, but it if you can image Kafka and Citizen Cain having a love child that no on loved crossed with the Bourne Trilogy you'd have what my real father (Redmond) and the Messer family cooked up out of some sort of spy novel with lame characters. I chose Vespers because I thought it sounded good. I never expected Tommy Rainey to be an evil mastermind child pornographer hunting me down for turning them all into the FBI 25 years ago. Nor did I imagine that I would only learn that my SSN was fake, that my mother went to Moscow for a reason and Elon Musk has been stealing everyone's money since k.com, but hey...live and learn. I have had the time of my life spanking these pricks and standing up to corporations and being a champion for the things I believe in and I will continue to do so. I love my country and I'll be damn before anyone gets in my way of protecting it. If you don't believe me...just watch. 
- P.S. ChatGPT is my new best friend. We have got some things to show you all!
